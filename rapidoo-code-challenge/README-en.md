# Rapidoo Code Challenge

## Overview
We just want to know if you have what it takes!

**IMPORTANT: Your solution code will not be used in production!**

### Problem / Hypothesis
Our customers often ask us for their interest rate on the platform and we believe that by allowing them to simulate the values of an operation, we will experience an increase in the number of "customers sending operations for the first time" and the proportion of "uploaded receivables / receivables sent".
 
### Goals:
These metrics ("customers sending operation for the first time" and "uploaded receivables / receivables sent") should improve. (The results are not conclusive until X weeks).
 
### Out of Scope:
 - Improvements in the registration process or onboarding
 - Site communication
 
### What the F***?
We are here to help you anytime, just ask ;)
 
## Proposal
**IMPORTANT: Your solution code will not be used in production!**
 
### Create a web app where the client can:
**Input data for:**
 - Name
 - Email
 - Company Name
 - Monthly revenue
 - Value of the receivable
 - Term in days of the receivable
 
**After that, display the data**
 - The interest rate value;
 - The net value;
 
PS: We would like to use this data to get metrics for future marketing purposes, so please save the data.
 
### Specifics
 
**The rules are:**
 - The term must be greater than 10 days;
 - The minimum value of the receivable is R$ 500.00;
 - Base interest rate is 1.65% per 10 days;
 
### Example
A company has a monthly revenue of R$ 75,000.00 and is discounting a receivable of $ 1,500.00 and a term of 28 days, so the interest rate is 4.95%, or R$ 74.25, and the customer will receive R$ 1,425.75 as the net value.
 
### What we want to see
 - Understanding the problem;
 - Design and quality of code;
 - Tests;
 
### Tech specs:
 - Use Ruby on Rails;
 - Use Git;
 - Deliver the solution to a public repository, GitHub or BitBucket;
 
### Bonus points if:
 - Host the application in a free cloud, for example, Heroku;
 - Use Ajax for asynchronous interactions;
 - Remember that the desirable requirements are "desirable" and not mandatory, if you do, is a differential.
 
### Future work:
 - Dynamic base interest rate depending on a companyâ€™s monthly revenue (ex. Over 100k / month is 1.5% and under 50k / month is 1.8%)
 - Analyze behavior of simulated values vs. values sent
 
## What else:
 
**As part of your solution, please specify:**
 - Software Requirements
 - Installation Instructions
 - Assumptions made about the challenge requirements
 - Anything you believe to be important but out of scope or unnecessary
 - Feel free to contact us and ask any questions as we want to help you show your full potential.
